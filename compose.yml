# The original compose file (https://github.com/sprintcube/docker-compose-lamp/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
# used a lot of environment variables (which go in an .env file in the
# same directory as the compose.yml file), which makes sense...except
# there were a lot of variables in the original env (https://github.com/sprintcube/docker-compose-lamp/blob/master/sample.env)
# that aren't used in this 3512 box, or which I felt obscured what
# was actually going on, or made it harder to read this compose file.

    # Instead of using volumes or bind mounts, you can use watch. So if
    # something changes in a given host path (like www, the Apache default.conf,
    # or PHP's php.ini), we can cause a sychronization (and restart, if
    # a server needs to be restarted, for example) to happen.

        #   and our router (rooted at index.php) goes in here; everything else
        #   (views, controllers, etc) will go in the public subdirectory.
        # - Since the action is sync, after a save is done on any file in here,
        #   refreshing the page will show the result of the new files. If
        #   you have a tool to force a browser refresh to happen when that
        #   occurs, so much the better.
